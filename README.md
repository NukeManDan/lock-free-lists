# lock-free-lists
Learning how to do lock free programming in Rust
Working from this paper for the Set/Map: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2001-caslists.pdf

I don't know that this is the best performance way to do this, especially the way I tried with the Map implementation.

TODO: benchmarks to get an idea on relative performance against other data structures with just a simple mutex.
